# glance

An independently authored MIT desktop image viewer, built with Rust and
eframe/egui's wgpu renderer. This first increment opens **JPEG (`jpg`, `jpeg`)
and PNG**; it is not yet the complete planned viewer.

```sh
make run ARGS='/absolute/path/to/image.png'
# Or:
cargo run --locked -- /absolute/path/to/folder
make build
./target/release/glance /absolute/path/to/image.png
```

Open with ⌘O on macOS / Ctrl+O on Linux, **File → Open…**, the **Open…** button
in empty/loading/error states, or the canvas's right-click menu. Files and folders
can also be dropped onto the window. A directory opens its first eligible image.
Folder browsing is nonrecursive and skips dot-prefixed/Finder-hidden names.
Explicitly opened hidden or missing files remain selected on opening. Corrupt
files stay in the list and show a named error; navigation and Open remain available.

Left/Right select previous/next; Home/End select first/last, without wrapping.
The **Navigate → Sort** submenu offers natural Name A→Z/Z→A, Size largest/smallest
first, and Modified newest/oldest first, indicating the active choice. Sort
persists for this session, including across Open. Before every navigation or sort,
a worker rescans the folder and reads current metadata. Sorting preserves the
selected path, not its index. If the current file disappears, navigation uses the
old order to find a surviving neighbor in the requested direction (then the other
direction at a boundary). New files join the snapshot; missing files leave it.
Natural names use ASCII case folding and numeric-run comparison (`image2` before
`image10`), then exact-name ties; metadata ties use this same ascending name order
in either direction. Unavailable metadata sorts before known values in ascending
metadata order and after known values in descending order.

Images start centered at Fit without enlarging small images. **View → Fit** (`0`
or `1`) recenters; **Actual Size (100%)** (`2`) displays one source pixel per
physical screen pixel, including HiDPI. `+` (or `=`) and `−` zoom about the canvas
center. A line-unit mouse wheel zooms at the pointer, clamped to 0.01×–500×.
Drag or two-axis point-unit trackpad scrolling pans when the image exceeds the
viewport; scrolling never navigates. Ctrl/Command+scroll also zooms at the pointer.
Fit and all zoom/pan state reset on file change. Menus are keyboard-accessible
with Tab/Shift+Tab to focus and Enter/Space to activate; viewer shortcuts are
suppressed while menus or another control own focus.

The title reports filename and position/count. A single background worker holds
one replaceable pending selection; only the current generation may be displayed.
Settled images have no application repaint timer.

## Current limits and remaining work

Input reads are bounded at 64 MiB. Decoder output and RGBA8 output are each bounded
at 512 MiB; sides are limited to the smaller of 16384 pixels and the device's
texture limit. `image::Limits` explicitly bounds dimensions and requests a
512 MiB decoder allocation cap; the allocation cap is best-effort upstream,
not a total process-RSS guarantee. Input, decode/conversion, UI texture staging,
and GPU/native allocations may coexist. One worker and bounded pending/result
slots prevent growth per keypress. These interim calibration values were raised
after real 38MP content was rejected; the full-detail presentation envelope
(including tiling and high-depth support) remains future work.

Embedded orientation is applied once. Presentation currently uses an image-only
wgpu paint callback with an sRGB RGBA8 texture and linear sampling. Transparency
is composited over the dark canvas in linear light, and output encoding follows
the actual attachment format. This interim straight-alpha filtering path does
not yet claim halo-free strong minification. Deliberate ICC/SDR conversion,
high-depth presentation, mipmaps, and oversized-image tiling are **not implemented
yet**. Other formats (including explicitly deferred XCF) give an unsupported-format
error. Animation, rotation/mirror/flip, clipboard/reveal, native menus/document-open
integration, packaging and Linux desktop validation are later increments.
Interactive zoom/pan feel and real input-device classification still need human
verification on target desktops. No qView code or assets are included.

## Development and quality gates

The pinned Rust toolchain is **1.97.1**, with rustfmt and Clippy. Install it yourself
before running checks; gates do not install tools, update the lockfile, or fix files.
`Cargo.lock` is committed. Linux builds need the normal windowing/graphics system
libraries and a working X11 or Wayland desktop; this increment has only been
smoke-tested on macOS arm64, not certified on Linux.

| Make target | Direct command / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `help` (default) | List targets |
| `fmt` | `cargo fmt --all` — explicitly modifies source |
| `fmt-check` | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` |
| `check` | `cargo check --workspace --all-targets --locked` |
| `clippy` | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` |
| `test` | `cargo test --workspace --locked` |
| `verify` | Sequential, fail-fast fmt-check → check → clippy → test, even with `make -j` |
| `precommit` | `git diff --cached --check`, then working-tree fmt-check and check |
| `build` | `cargo build --release --locked` |
| `run` | `cargo run --locked -- $(ARGS)` |

Diagnostics and failing exit statuses are not filtered. Checks do not format,
fix, stash, stage, clean, or overwrite hooks. Cargo will create normal ignored
build artifacts. Tests create original fixtures in uniquely named temporary
folders, not from legacy assets.

### Opt-in dependency audits

Install the tested developer-tool versions explicitly (never installed by make):

```sh
cargo install cargo-deny --version 0.20.2 --locked
cargo install cargo-machete --version 0.9.2 --locked
make audit
make machete
```

`audit` runs `cargo deny --locked check` across the resolved graph, including
platform-specific crates: license policy in `deny.toml`, security advisories and
yanked releases (no ignores), duplicate-version warnings, wildcard bans, and
crates.io-only sources. LLVM license riders are allowed only for the listed
crate versions; permissive OR alternatives do not authorize copyleft licenses.
The allowlist includes bundled font licenses; distribution still needs the
notices described in `THIRD_PARTY.md`.

`machete` runs `cargo machete` to detect unused direct dependencies. Both targets
are non-mutating with respect to tracked files and fail clearly if the tool is
missing. Cargo and cargo-deny may populate local caches or fetch advisory data;
audit results depend on the current advisory database and registry state.
They are intentionally outside `verify` and the pre-commit hook: these opt-in,
CI-tier dependency checks require extra tools and advisory/network access, while
`verify` remains fmt-check → check → clippy → test.

### Opt-in pre-commit hook

From the repository root:

```sh
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
# Review the validation result, then activate manually:
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The helper validates the tracked hook and refuses a conflicting effective
`core.hooksPath` or an existing default pre-commit hook. **It never writes Git
configuration or installs/overwrites a hook.** The tracked hook executes
`make precommit`. Activation is optional and must be done by you.

**Partial-staging caveat:** staged whitespace is checked, but formatting and
compilation use the whole working tree. This does not compile an isolated
partially staged snapshot. Run `make verify` against the actual complete tree
before review. The local hook is intentionally lighter than full verification.

## Licensing

Glance is MIT; see `LICENSE`. Direct dependencies are pinned to eframe 0.36.2
(MIT OR Apache-2.0), image 0.25.10 (MIT OR Apache-2.0), and rfd 0.17.2 (MIT).
The viewer directly enables only image's JPEG/PNG codecs, but eframe's transitive
clipboard integration also enables TIFF in the resolved image graph; the viewer
does not dispatch TIFF. egui's bundled default fonts have their own notices.
See `THIRD_PARTY.md` for the resolved crate/license inventory and distribution
limitations. No third-party library source has been modified.
